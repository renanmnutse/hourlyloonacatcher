# hourlyloonacatcher

This is the Open Source repository for the hourlyloonacatcher bot. Hourlyloonacatcher combines LOONA and Dreamcatcher pictures using AI, more specifically Image Clustering techniques and a random pipeline to try and feature different girls each hour.

This repository was made in collaboration with https://github.com/PauloRVdC/.

Hourlyloonacatcher has a carrd (https://hourlyloonacatcher.carrd.co) and the pictures chosen by the bot can be found at https://twitter.com/hloonacatcher.
